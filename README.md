This was my personal GitHub account, no longer active.

Between 2021-2023, I was active as a core contributor to web framework projects, focusing on documentation and dev education. Here you can also find some educational technology prototypes that I mostly built in high school and early college.

In spring 2023, a [severe mood episode](https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Bipolar-Disorder/Overview#:~:text=Moods%20can%20rapidly,of%20their%20actions.) escalated to a full-blown break over the course of a few months. During that time, I caused immeasurable damage to the projects and communities I was a part of, and, more crushingly, to the colleagues and friends I'd made over the years.

I'm not here to explain away what I did: you're free to judge me based on my actions, which are well-documented online by the people I hurt. In the pursuit of helping others avoid similar outcomes for themselves or their loved ones with bipolar disorder: if you do want to learn more about my mental health history, what led to this episode (and the depressive one in 2022), and what I'm doing now to prevent future episodes, my email in my profile.

Many people who were directly affected expressed their desire for me to stay away. Because of that, I decided not to reach out and apologize unless they first made contact with me. If you're one of them and would like that, please feel free to reach out. My phone number is the same as it was in early 2023.

To everyone, I want to make clear that I don't stand by what I said and did. I fully regret those actions, and (as a less important point, but important to me nonetheless) I believe I wouldn't have taken those actions before the episode or after it.
