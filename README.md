I've always been interested in educational technology: how can we use tech to help people learn? 

These days, I'm also focused on the other side of that coin: how can we help people learn tech?

To me, they're the same idea: we can apply tech to help people learn tech. I'm working on docs and content that applies ideas from educational technology to push effective learning to the next level.

Get in touch - the best way is by email (in my GitHub profile) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jutanium).
